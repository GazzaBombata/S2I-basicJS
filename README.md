# S2I-basicJS - Cat Counter

## Project Description
Cat Counter is a fun and interactive web application where users can increase or decrease a counter. Each increment of the counter generates a random image of a cat and displays a whimsical cat-related message. The application is built with plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, showcasing the power of vanilla web development (with just a little bit of Bootstrap).

## Features
- **Counter Control**: Users can increase or decrease the counter using the +/- buttons.
- **Dynamic Image Generation**: Each increment displays a new cat image.
- **Random Messages**: Displays random cat-related messages in an alert box, which disappear after a few seconds.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
